## Summary

Hyperlight Improvement Proposals, otherwise known as HIPs, are largely influenced by the Kubernetes
Enhancement Proposal (KEP) process which provides a standardized development process for Hyperlight
enhancements. You can read more about the
[KEP process in 0000-kep-process here](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/0000-kep-process/README.md).

## Motivation

### Goals

1. Since Hyperlight is a smaller project than Kubernetes and has a smaller community of contributors, the
needs are slightly different from that of the Kubernetes project. HIPs do not strive to meet the rigor
of their inspiration in Kubernetes, but rather, to provide a means for communication of intent and a
historical record for the motivations that drove the improvement.

### Non-goals

1. To have all changes require a HIP. Only significantly impacting work should be stated as a HIP, e.g. 
a large refactoring, significant feature enhancements, breaking APIs, etc.
2. We will omit the use of KEP like metadata that is associated with KEPs.

## Proposal

We propose creating a standardized improvement proposal process for Hyperlight modeled after the Kubernetes
Enhancement Proposal process.
